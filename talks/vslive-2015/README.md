## Title: .NET Applications at Scale on Amazon Web Services

Amazon Web Services (AWS) has over 50 services to help developers build and deploy any type of application at scale. Running an application at scale means the environment running your application has the elasticity to grow and shrink depending on the current demands of your application. The session will teach you how to use AWS services from C#, PowerShell and Visual Studio. We will also examine how we can deploy traditional .NET web applications as well as the latest ASP.NET 5 framework on AWS. With our deployed application we will take a look at the AWS services that can help our application scale for expected and unexpected demand.
