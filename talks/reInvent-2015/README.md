# AWS re:Invent 2015 Demo Code and Scripts

For AWS re:Invent 2015 we gave to breakout sessions. Here contains all the code, PowerShell scripts and CloudFormation templates used for the talks


### DEV302 - Hosting ASP.NET 5 applications in AWS with Docker and AWS CodeDeploy

The .NET Platform is undergoing a revolution with a new modularized .NET Framework and CoreCLR, a new cross platform runtime. ASP.NET 5 gives .NET developers the ability to develop and run their applications outside of Windows. In this session we will explore how to develop and deploy ASP.NET 5 applications on Windows with AWS CodeDeploy and Linux with Docker. For Docker we will explore using Docker with both Elastic Beanstalk and EC2 Container Service.

### DEV202 - Under the Desk to the AWS Cloud with Windows PowerShell

In this session, we will examine how to use AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell to move a typical in-house application, housed on a "server under someone's desk", to the cloud. We will cover importing the server as a virtual machine image running an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2). We will then show how to configure, maintain, and monitor the running instances by automating AWS infrastructure, including the provisioning of the AWS resources, Amazon EC2 Simple Systems Manager (SSM), and Amazon CloudWatch.
